TODO:
1. shrink to width = 300
2. merge feature extraction
3. add featrue to database, provide "Regenerate feature" function
4. DOM top-down traversal, seeking for elements with width < window width. Make this element the "root" node.
5. maybe retrieving widths and heights of second-level elements, draw rectangles with that width and height on canvas with different color, so that areas are more obvious to our segmentation program.
